1. Outputs:

- Current asset allocations (optimized)

- Graphs of historical performance of all portfolios
  - Min volatility
  - Max return
  - Max risk-adjusted return
  - Benchmark1 (Buy&Hold of initial allocation)
  - Benchmark2 (SPX500)

- KPIs of all portfolios
  - CAGR (compound annual %return)
  - Maximum drawdown (in %)
  - Volatility
  - Sharpe + Sortino ratios
  - MAR + Calmar ratios
  - VaR 1% and VaR 5% for 1 Day + 2 Weeks (industry standard)


2. Inputs:

- Historical data of assets
  - Webcrawling
  - store price data in database (SQL)

- User inputs / Default Values:
  - Rebalancing period (days) / 90
  - Starting allocations in % / equal distribution
  - Asset selection / none
  - UPGRADE: Min allocation per asset in % / 1
  - UPGRADE: Max allocation per asset in % / 100
  - UPGRADE: Allocation steps in % / 0.5 [0.1-10]
  - UPGRADE: Optimization period (days) / 90)



3. Calculations:
- KPIs
- Optimization max profit:
  - iterate over all possible combinations of asset allocations within the min/max range of the selected portfolio
  - find the combination with highest profit within the optimization period
  - return asset allocation
- UPGRADE: Optimization min risk:
  - iterate over all possible combinations of asset allocations within the min/max range of the selected portfolio
  - find the combination with lowest volatility within the optimization period
  - return asset allocation
- UPGRADE: Optimization max risk-adjusted return:
  - iterate over all possible combinations of asset allocations within the min/max range of the selected portfolio
  - find the combination with highest sharpe(sortino) ratio
  - return asset allocation
- Forecasting of asset allocation:
  - Optimize for period T-1
  - Optimize for current period
  - Take difference of optimization T-1 and T0
  - Apply difference on top of T0 optimization = forecast
  - UPGRADE: Take difference of optimization T-1 and "real" results of that allocation
  - UPGRADE: Calculate average of difference T-1/T0 optimization and T-1/real and add it to current optimization
- UPGRADE: Do this forecasting for all 3 optimization types
